            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T hath perhaps already been wondred at, that ſuch a one as I, whoſe meanneſſes are not unknown, have been ſo hardy, as to adventure to preach upon a Theme ſo knotty and perplex, as is <hi>the Propheſie of the two Witneſſes,</hi> and now to make thoſe Notions more publike, may poſsibly revive the wonderment, and this ſecond undertaking render me more hardy (that I ſay no more) then did the former. In neither perhaps am I wholly to be excuſed; yet when you know all, at least I may be pardoned.</p>
            <p>The great deſire I had to gain ſome light to theſe dark times, drew me to beſtow ſeverall exerciſes upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; the deſire of ſome friends drew me thus to publiſh them. If for the firſt I be challenged, it muſt indeed wholly fall upon my ſelf; If for the latter, there are thoſe that muſt ſhare the blame with me.</p>
            <p>For the Subject, I cannot conceive how that ſhould come unacceptable to any; we all ſtrongly deſire to know what ſhall become of us: And could we but meet with any <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Prognoſtication, calculated for theſe times, and alſo for this our Meridian,</hi> nothing more welcome: Such do ſome conceive is this <hi>Propheſie of the Witneſſes;</hi> which whether ſo or no, once I am aſſured; the cleering of this ſame, would accordingly, or help our preparations for ſuch a ſtorm as this ſhall bring with it; or elſe relieve us
<pb facs="tcp:111659:3"/> from much diſcouragement and fear, while we dayly look for it.</p>
            <p>It is indeed a matter intricate, <hi>dignus vindice nodus,</hi> ſuch as not unworthily is become the great Enquiry of theſe times, and doubtleſſe worthy a much other hand then mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e, who firſt profeſſedly undertook it: which duely weighing. I have endeavoured, with all becoming modeſty, to deal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n it.</p>
            <p>It was not (if I know my heart) the great confidence I had upon my ſelf, that made me adventure upon this ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult undertaking; nor yet the preſumption I had, I could do much in it. Onely I have thought I might either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute ſomewhat my ſelf in this buſineſſe, at leaſt ſhould provoke others that might contribute: In which latter, ſure I am, I have not been miſtaken; for though before I began, there was deep ſilence in this matter, yet ſince have ſeverall fallen upon it profeſſedly alſo.</p>
            <p>If you meet with miſtakes in this Diſcourſe, to ſome the difficulty of the buſineſſe will eaſily entitle me; to others, the want of time to make ſerious reviſings: In which lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I muſt needs tell you I was much ſtraitned. I had but thoſe Notes I uſed in Preaching, whereby immediately, and not from any other Copy, I was fain at once to form and tranſcribe theſe; the Preſſe drew them from me piece after piece; and many times preventing the quickneſſe of my writing, ſtayed for me; I having never had the opportunity till all had paſſed the Preſſe, to view altogether. In all which the equall Reader will conſider me;</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE main reaſon, why I undertook the task of this Propheſie, Is to try to ſatisfie that common queſtion almoſt in every ones Mouth, <hi>What will become of us? What do you think of theſe times?</hi> To anſwer this from providences, ſeemed to me altogether impoſſible, they are diſpenſed toward us with ſo much variety: We fear to day, hope to morrow; ſo that from our preſent condition, there is no preſaging what will be our future. But then I thought <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 19.</note> could we finde out <hi>ſome more ſure word of propheſie;</hi> ſuch as might in a more ſpeciall manner relate to our times, this might contribute much to our ſatisfaction, in the inſufficiency of the other. And while I was thus caſting, this <hi>propheſie of the two Witneſſes,</hi> offers it ſelf, of all thoſe that I can imagine moſt likely to aym at our times, and ſo beſt to ſerve the purpoſe above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.

               <p>And for coherence, that we may know where about we are, take this much; Some great Interpreters conceive the holy Ghoſt having finiſhed the <hi>propheſie of the Seals,</hi> only ſomewhat remaining of the <hi>laſt Trumpet,</hi> becauſe there was an other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie. <hi>viz.</hi> That which ſet forth the condition of the Church, (beginning and ending with that of the Seals) not as yet men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; till ſuch time as ſo much of the Churches <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nth Chapter till this be done; which being done in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of this Chapter, to the 15 verſe; there the ſeventh Trumpet is brought in to be the common cloſe and Cataſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe of them both.</p>
               <p>By this reckoning, the beginning of this eleventh Chapter, wherein you <hi>have a Temple, Altar, and worſhippers meaſured,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents <note place="margin">Verſ. 1.</note> to us the Churches condition in the Apoſtles dayes, and thoſe primative times neer about, and that which immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follows, the Churches ſtate now gotten within the verge of thoſe times wherein Antichriſt was to prevail.

               <p>I ſhould rather with ſubmiſſion conceive, <hi>By the Temple, Altar, and Worſhippers,</hi> are meant reſpectively, the <hi>pure wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips and worſhippers,</hi> continuing all the time of Antichriſt, the meaſuring of theſe denoting this much, That during this time of Antichriſts pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

               <p>If this, the meaning of the former words, joyn this of the witneſſes to them, and the dependance lies cleerly thus: Then when the Antichriſtian Gentiles begin to take poſſeſſion of the outward Court, when Antichriſt begins to <hi>ſit in the Temples of</hi>

               <p>Having found out thus much for connection, we proceed now to take a view of the Propheſie it ſelf, the bulk whereof

               <p>In which, who ſo dim ſighted, as not to perceive <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> as with the finger pointed at? both which, when enemies have riſen up againſt them, have had the wrong by ſire avenged upon thoſe enemies. So you reade of <hi>Moſes</hi> in the 16 of <hi>Numb.</hi> when <hi>Korah,</hi> and with him two hundred and fifty chief men of the Congregation, make there a tumult againſt him: at the 35 verſe of that Chapter, <hi>Fire proceedeth from the Lord, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyes thoſe two hundred and fifty.</hi> Of <hi>Elias</hi> alſo, you have it ſtoried in the 2 of <hi>Kinos</hi> and 1.

                  <hi>from heaven, and deſtroyes both the Captains, and both their fifties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Both theſe you have here a reference to, and this not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the ſame thing done, but (which is my apprehenſion, which alſo I touched upon before) becauſe there is a reſemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:111659:9"/> intended betwixt the doers alſo. I ſaid before, the two Olive trees did not onely ſignifie the like common work happening to <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> and <hi>Jeſhua,</hi> and to the Witneſſes, but ſeemed to hold forth a likeneſſe or ſameneſſe in the quality of the perſons alſo. So likewiſe, when in a further deſcription of theſe Witneſſes; we have them rendered ſuch, Out of whoſe mouthes ſire procceding, deſtroyes their enemies (a plain alluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias)</hi> I ſhould conceive, 'tis not only to ſhew the ſame thing done by all of them, and no more, but to tell us the perſons in reſemblance are another <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> alſo.</p>
               <p>And to make this yet ſeem more likely, obſerve we how juſt their work falls alike to all of them. Doth <hi>Moſes</hi> lead <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt?</hi> and do not theſe Witneſſes lead the Chriſtian <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of the <hi>Romiſh Egypt,</hi> of which no queſtion <hi>Moſes</hi> his former leading was a type? And doth <hi>Elias</hi> ſtand zealous for God, in that grand <hi>Apoſtaſie</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> no doubt a type of this grand Apoſtaſie of Antichriſt; and are not the Witneſſes cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the <hi>zealous Spirit</hi> of <hi>Elias;</hi> nay, is it not <hi>doubled</hi> upon <note place="margin">2 Kin. 2. 9.</note> them, who dare contend with the Antichriſtian Apoſtates, even then when their Idolatries have ſo over overwhelmed the world, that they onely are left oppoſing?</p>
               <p>And if this ſo, and there's no <hi>new thing in all this,</hi> the ſame Scene come about again; what ſtrange thing to ſee the ſame actors? and if now in the laſt act of the world there is a bringing out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſuch as was before; a contending with Apoſtates, as there was before; how every way elegant to make <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> the actors here alſo.</p>
               <p>Having thus found out the Witneſſes to be <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> now, as we ſaw them <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> and <hi>Jeſhua</hi> (men of like qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and employment) before, leſt we miſtake the ſpeciall thing that's here mentioned done by them; we now proceed to a particular examination of it, <hi>If any man will harm them, fire proceeds, &amp;c.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>To anſwer this in ſhort: The Word of God in Scripture is ſeverall times compar'd to <hi>fire, Jer.</hi> 20 9. <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 29. <hi>Is not my Word like as a fire, ſaith the Lord?</hi> But eſpecially caſt your eye upon the 5 of <hi>Jer.</hi> 14. where you finde the Lord thus beſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Prophet: <hi>And I will make my Word in thy meuth fire, and this people as wood, and it ſhall devour them.</hi>

               <p>A place ſo parallel, ſo plain an interpretation of what we have in hand, that to me it ſeems altogether needleſſe to enquire any further meaning. Obſerve it, there you have the Lord threatning that People by the Prophet, but his word is ſlighted, and the Prophet that delivers the meſſage miſuſed; for this cauſe, <hi>the Lords Word in the Prophets mouth ſhall be fire, and that People wood, and it ſhall devour them.</hi> So here, you have the Witneſſes teſtifying againſt Antichriſt, for his great impieties; this teſtimony of theirs is ſlighted, themſelves oppoſed and miſuſed; to avenge which indignitie, fire comes out of their mouthes, takes hold of their oppoſers, they threaten Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, God accordingly executes them; thus <hi>fire proceeds out of their mouth, and devours their enemies.</hi> All this but confirming that of the Apoſtle; The Goſpel, and its Miniſters, <hi>have in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The meaning given thus piece-meal, put all together, and the reſult is this: <hi>Theſe two Witneſſes, formerly</hi> Zerubbabel and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhuah, now becauſe of like ſpirit, and employment, but expreſly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in like manner protected from enemies, are</hi> Moſes <hi>and</hi> Elias, <hi>whom if any man ſhall attempt to harm, by denouncing and praying Judgements, they procure certain deſtruction upon them.</hi>

               <p>I ſaid before, The Scriptures, the two Teſtaments, were the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of theſe Witneſſes, but denyed them to be the <hi>Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes themſelves,</hi> becauſe they are deſcribed <hi>as men, and by men,</hi> but then gave proof of neither; but now I hope 'tis evident they are deſcribed as men, and men of former times, ſuch as <hi>Zerub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babel</hi> and <hi>Jeſhua,</hi> brought in to perſonate theſe Witneſſes which, together with that which follows, gives abundant, and every was ſatisfying evidence in this matter.</p>

               <p>Before you heard they <hi>purſue their enemies with fire,</hi> here they <hi>ſhut heaven</hi> againſt them, <hi>turn their waters into bloud, and ſmite their earth with all plagues as often as they will.</hi> What a miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble plight are the enemies of theſe Witneſſes in, who have the <hi>fire</hi> armed againſt them before, and now the benefits of <hi>heaven, earth, water,</hi> all taken from them?</p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:111659:11"/>
               <p>But let us take them in order; firſt, <hi>Theſe have power to ſhut heaven, that it rain not in the dayes of their prophecie:</hi> In which <note place="margin">Jam. 5. 17.</note> who ſees not the forementioned <hi>Elias</hi> a new pointed at, of whom it is recorded, that praying he <hi>ſhut up heaven that it rained not,</hi> (the ſame <hi>thing</hi> here mentioned) and <hi>this for three yeers and a half;</hi> the juſt <hi>terme</hi> of theſe Witneſſes propheſie in ſackcloth.</p>
               <p>But that we miſtake not by underſtanding all this in the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I mean either the <hi>thing</hi> it ſelf, or the <hi>time,</hi> we muſt again borrow the the word <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                  </gap>, enquiring out a myſticall underſtanding of them both.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>time</hi> I have touched upon it before, and hereafter may have occaſion further to ſhew 'tis to be reckoned according to the propheticall account, every day in this three yeers and a half, being put for a yeer, as is the manner of propheſies ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time to reckon, and then for their <hi>ſhutting up heaven that it rain not;</hi> we ſhall now trie to finde out ſome myſticall meaning of it.</p>
               <p>For this purpoſe therefore, in that <hi>Matt.</hi> 16. 19. you have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Keyes ſhutting heaven: heaven is then ſhut,</hi> according to the minde of that place, when ſuch as live in ignorance, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſſe, idolatry, or any the like groſſe wickedneſſe, are by the Miniſtery of the Word, declared a people to who no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, no forgiveneſſe, no heaven doth belong.</p>
               <p>However I doubt not but the ſame thing is meant in both places, yet in regard it is there, <hi>heaven ſhut that people cannot enter,</hi> here <hi>heaven ſhut that it do not rain,</hi> and ſo, though in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance they come both to one, yet the alluſion ſeems not ſo clear; we ſhall therefore trie further.</p>
               <p>The glad tydings of the Goſpell are ſeverall times in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture compared to <hi>rain,</hi> (this me thinks will nick the alluſion:) I ſay again, the tydings of forgiveneſſe, mercie, &amp;c. are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in Scripture compared to <hi>rain;</hi> ſo <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 2. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45. 8, &amp;c. and ſure could we ſtay to ſhew it, we ſhould finde the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance patt, and every way anſweing. Doth rain refreſh the weary and thirſty earth? doth it ſoften? doth it make frutfull? and do not the glad tydings of the Goſpell, the tydings of peace, forgiveneſſe, refreſh, ſoften, make fruitfull alſo?</p>
               <p>This ſo, ſhall we ſay accordingly, then do theſe Witneſſes <hi>ſhut</hi>

                  <hi>heaven that it rain not,</hi> when they with hold all tydings of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe, mercy, peace, from the Antichriſtian Gentiles, while they continue ſuch, (the Church the mean while being refreſhed with theſe ſhowers every day) and further declare, as that third Angell does, <hi>Chap.</hi> 14. verſ. 9, 10, 11. (who no doubt is of theſe witneſſes) that ſuch as thoſe who <hi>worſhip the Beaſt, and receive his marke, ſhall drink of the wrath of God;</hi> no mercy, no forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe at all appertains to them And thus the former <hi>ſhutting heaven</hi> in <hi>Matth.</hi> and the withholding of the rain of heaven here, do now appear to be the ſame; of which the ſumme in ſhort is this much.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As</hi> Elias <hi>ſhut heaven that it rained not upon thoſe apoſtate Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites whil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>We have ſeen the Witneſſes <hi>power to ſhut heaven that it rain not,</hi> laid open; <hi>their turning waters into bloud, and ſmiting the earth with all plagues, as often as the will,</hi> next follows; which in regard they both concern the ſame thing, as may appear by and by; in the handling of them therefore we ſhall joyn both together.</p>
               <p>And here me thinks we meet with ſome thing like the <hi>vials,</hi> thoſe <hi>ſeven vials</hi> (I mean) emptying out upon Antichriſt the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <note place="margin">Rev. 15. 1.</note> laſt plagues of the wrath of God. And becauſe this ſeems not unlikely, and the cleering of this will help us to underſtand the words; as alſo not a little cond<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ce to ſatisfie in that great queſtion, <hi>Whether the time of theſe witneſſes be paſt, yea or no,</hi> (as we ſhall ſee hereafter:) our ſatisfaction in which is the great deſigne we drive in all this undertaking: we ſhall therefore firſt enquire, whether at all we have any thing here relating to the vials, yea, or no; and when this is done, then proceed to take a view of the words more particularly.</p>
               <p>The grounds perſwading to beleeve the Vials are here meant, are ſuch as theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Thoſe plagues of the Vials, and theſe here, do fall together into the ſame time, the ſpace of the ſixth Trumpet receives both
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:111659:12"/> of them. The Vials (ſo many waſtes and graduall deſtructions of the beaſt) muſt needs be pouring forth the time of the ſixth Trumpet: for at the beginning of the ſeventh, with which the laſt Vials falls in, the <hi>beaſt his time is no more:</hi> [the beaſt, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt] is then deſtroyed by an utter &amp; irrecoverable deſtruction. The tenth Chapter of this Propheſie, and ſixth verſe, compared with the ſixteenth Chapter, 17, and 19 Verſes, cleers this ſame to any, that ſhall with care and obſervation examine them.</p>
               <p>And that the plagues here mentioned bear the ſame date, fall in with the time of the ſixth Trumpet alſo, hence appears; for theſe plagues being chiefly drawn forth by theſe witneſſes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the end of their Propheſie, and that ending with the <hi>ſixth Trumpet</hi> [the <hi>ſecond Wo]</hi> as is plain from the 13 and 14 verſ. of this Chapter; who ſees not that theſe fall in with the <hi>time of the ſixth Trumpet</hi> alſo? And ſo becauſe thoſe plagues, and theſe here, are both wrapt up in the <hi>ſixth Trumpet,</hi> and ſo fall into the ſame time, this is one inducement perſwading they are the ſame plagues alſo.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thoſe who pour forth the Vialls, and the Witneſſes who inflict the plagues here mentioned, ſeem all the <hi>ſame perſons.</hi> The <hi>Angels</hi> who pour out the <hi>Vialls</hi> deſcribed <hi>coming forth of the Temple, clothed with pure and white linnen, and their breſts</hi>

                  <hi>girded with golden girdles,</hi> who are they but godly ones, whether Magiſtrates or Miniſters; who appertaining to, or coming forth of Reformed Churches, do <hi>pour forth the Vialls.</hi> And are not the Witneſſes who execute theſe plagues godly Magiſtrates and Miniſters, who pertrining to the Temple mentioned at the firſt Verſe of this Chapter; that is, The Churches reformed, come forth thence, and inflict theſe plagues upon the Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Gentiles? And indeed how can we imagine that any ſhould come forth of Reformed Churches, and pour out a Viall a plague, upon the Antichriſtian party, and not be of theſe Witneſſes? when ſuch is the nature of the plagues con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Vialls, as we may ſee by and by, that in nothing can any more openly and effectually witneſſe againſt Antichriſt, and the Antichriſtian brood, then by pouring out any of theſe Vialls upon them. They are the ſame perſons then, the godly Magiſtrates and Miniſters of Reformed Churches, that pour forth the Vials, and that execute the plagues the Text here menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:111659:13"/>
               <p n="3">3. As they fall out at the ſame time, are inflicted by the ſame hands, ſo upon enquire you will finde them the ſame plagues alſo. To cleer this ſame: Have you <hi>here [a turning waters into blood?]</hi> upon the pouring out of the ſecond and third Vials you have the <hi>waters then turned to blood alſo.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>I muſt not diſſemble what diſſent I finde in this matter, ſome conceiving, theſe plagues here mentioned, do rather relate to ſome of the foremoſt Trumpets, which ſounding, you finde the <hi>like plaguing the earth, and turning of waters into blood,</hi> even <note place="margin">Chap. 8. Verſ. 7. 8.</note> ſuch like plagues as you have here mentioned.</p>
               <p>With ſubmiſſion I cannot conceive thoſe plagues to be the ſame with thoſe of the firſt and ſecond Trumpet, for theſe Reaſons:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Not to mention thoſe, which prove theſe the ſame with the Vialls, firſt, becauſe theſe fall within the time of the <hi>ſixth Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet,</hi> as (we ſhewed before) and therefore cannot be the plagues of the <hi>firſt and ſecond Trumpet;</hi> the conſequence is cleer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the plagues comprized in the time of the <hi>ſixth Trumpet,</hi> muſt needs be a long ſpace after the plagues comprized in the time of the <hi>firſt and ſecond Trumpet;</hi> the <hi>ſixth Trumpet</hi> being a good ſpace after the <hi>firſt and ſecnod Trumpet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Thoſe plagues of the former Trumpets, and theſe of the Witneſſes, fall not upon the ſame <hi>ſubject:</hi> thoſe of the former Trumpets, as is evident to any obſervant Reader, falling upon <hi>Rome Chriſtian;</hi> theſe of the Witneſſes falling upon <hi>Rome Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian:</hi> to cleer this latter (the former being without queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) And is it not ſo, when becauſe of theſe plagues, you have <note place="margin">Verſ. 7.</note>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:111659:13"/> Antichriſt in the very next words, <hi>waging War witt theſe Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and ſlaying them?</hi> Is it not plain theſe plagues fall upon <note place="margin">Verſ. 20.</note> the Antichriſtian Party, when they are brought in at the tenth Verſe, <hi>rejoycing</hi> for their ſlaughter, and this expreſly the reaſon, Becauſe they were now got ſhut of thoſe, who while they lived, <hi>tormented them with all theſe plagues?</hi> The ſubject then of theſe is <hi>Rome Aniichristian; of the other, Rome Christian;</hi> and if ſo, they neither fall within the <hi>ſame time,</hi> nor upon <hi>the ſame ſubject,</hi> 'tis evident they cannot be the <hi>ſame plagues</hi> (the thing contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for) and if theſe be not the ſame, there being none other in all this Propheſie that do reſemble them, ſave onely the Vialls, it remains an unſhaken truth, the <hi>plagues</hi> here mentioned are no other then the <hi>Vialls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This much gained, we now proceed particularly to examine the words; <hi>Theſe have power over waters, to turn them into blood, &amp;c.</hi> In which who beholds not another <hi>pair,</hi> even <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> now coming forth to perſonate theſe Witneſſes: of whom we reade in ſacred Story. That bringing <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> they <hi>turned the Egyptian waters into blood, plagued the earth, &amp;c.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 7. Exod. 8.</note> the very ſame you have here done by the hands of theſe Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. And now you have the <hi>last pair,</hi> where by theſe Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are deſcribed: Formerly they were <hi>Zerubqabell</hi> and <hi>Jeſhua,</hi> after that <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> now in the cloſe of this repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they are <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron:</hi> There now wants nothing to make the deſcription of theſe Witneſſes compleat, but that we ſee what 'tis theſe Witneſſes do, that makes them appear another <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron;</hi> which done, we have then at once a full de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription and view of theſe Witneſſes.</p>
               <p>To this therefore I haſten, in entrance where upon, let me warn you as I did before, you are not to underſtand this ſame in the letter, namely, That indeed, and in the letter, the Witneſſes ſhould turn <hi>waters into blood;</hi> but as we underſtood their <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying their enemies with fire,</hi> their ſhutting <hi>heaven that it rain not,</hi> myſtically before, ſo muſt we underſtand their <hi>turning wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into blood</hi> alſo.</p>
               <p>But becauſe I have already ſhewn theſe plagues are no other then thoſe of the <hi>Vials,</hi> the better to compaſſe the meaning, it will not be amiſſe for us to turn over to the 16 Chapter of this Propheſie, where the Vialls are by the holy Ghoſt profeſſedly
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:111659:14"/> mentioned, where if we finde what's meant by <hi>[turning waters into blood,</hi> and <hi>ſmiting the earth with plagues</hi> there] we ſhal cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee what to underſtand by them here alſo, they being all one, onely here but glanced at, there by the holy Ghoſt profeſſedly and at large diſcovered.</p>
               <p>In that 16 Chapter therefore (for I turn over thither) we finde that upon the pouring forth of the ſecond and third Vials, <hi>the waters are turned into blood,</hi> hoth theſe I conceive are here pointed at. For the holy Ghoſt, ſeeming in this place to give a touch upon the Vials, ſumming them up briefly under two Heads, <hi>viz.</hi> either plagues on the <hi>waters,</hi> or plagues on the <hi>eatrh,</hi> and ſo to be apprehended, thruſting as many as would fall under an head together, there being <hi>two Vials</hi> that will come under this head of <hi>[turning waters into blood]</hi> who doth not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily conceive <hi>both theſe Vials</hi> muſt hereby be hereby ſignified? So that it will be needfull we enquire the meaning of them both.</p>
               <p>To begin therefore with the ſecond Vial, the firſt of thoſe that turn waters into blood, which in that 3 Verſe of the 16 Chapter we finde is poured out upon the <hi>Sea,</hi> and the effect, <hi>it become as the blood of a d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This the ſecond Vial.</p>
               <p>The third is poured forth upon the <hi>rivers,</hi> and <hi>fountains</hi> at the 4 Verſe, and the effect is, <hi>theſe become blood alſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then was this Vial poured forth (ſay Interpreters, whom I again refer to) when in the times of <hi>Queen Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> this State made a Law againſt <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> enacting it Treaſon for any to ſeduce this People to the Romiſh Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; upon which ſeverall of them, as <hi>Campian, Ducket, Sherwin,</hi>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:111659:14"/> and afterwards others were executed: and when at this day according to that Law we execute a Prieſt, or Jeſuite; then do we poure forth this <hi>Viall</hi> upon the <hi>Antichriſtian Waters,</hi> and they <hi>become bloud.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this reckoning (and ſo to bring all home to the Text) then are the witneſſes ſaid to <hi>turn the Antichriſtian Waters into bloud;</hi> when by their cleer writings, and other wayes they diſcover all that <hi>Sea of Popiſh doctrine to be but as the bloud of a dead man;</hi> and further do <hi>execute their Prieſts, and Jeſuites,</hi> who as <hi>Rivers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> do derive and carry from place to place, the <hi>Waters</hi> of this noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Sea, thereby to poyſon, and deſtroy the ſouls of ſeduced people.</p>
               <p>And by the way, who is not now fully ſatisfied, <hi>the Witneſſes poure forth the Vials</hi> (the thing we ſo induſtriouſly proved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) when having but mentioned two Vials, we find the godly Magiſtrates and Miniſters of the reformed Churches (whom all along we have ſhewn to be theſe two Witneſſes) have already poured forth both of them? The <hi>former,</hi> the godly <hi>Ministers,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Chemnitius, Chamier, Junius, Reignolds, &amp;c.</hi> The <hi>latter,</hi> the godly <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> as certain of the number of theſe Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes alſo. Thus <hi>theſe Witneſſes turn Waters into bloud.</hi> The next thing that follows, <hi>And they ſmite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will;</hi> this falls now in order to be enquired con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning.</p>
               <p>And to be ſhort, what can this mean, but (which we touched upon before) the pouring forth the other Vialls, all which at the firſt Verſe of that 16 Chapter, are commanded there to be <hi>poured forth upon the earth?</hi> And if this be ſo, you have then the ſumme of the former, and of this ſame, in one word this much, <hi>In that the Holy Ghoſt tells us, theſe Witneſſes turn Waters into bloud, and ſmite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will, 'tis all one, as if he had ſaid. Theſe Witneſſes do pour forth all the Vials.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now by this time you have had the Witneſſes at full ſhewed forth, you have ſeen <hi>who they are.</hi> They are <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> and <hi>Jeſhua; Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias; Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron:</hi> you have ſeen <hi>what they do.</hi> They ſpend themſelves into the <hi>Candleſticks;</hi> to the Churches they are as <hi>Oyl</hi> is to the Lamps; nouriſhing, and keeping them alive all the time of Antichriſts prevailing; if any
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:111659:15"/> attempt to wrong them, <hi>fire proceeds out of their mouths, and deſtroyes</hi> ſuch as do attempt it. And for the wrongs the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Gentiles offer the Church, theſe Witneſſes <hi>ſhut heaven upon them, that it rain not, nay pour forth all the Vials of the wrath of God upon them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus you have all the <hi>active</hi> part of theſe Witneſſes already drawn forth. That which follows, is their <hi>paſſive,</hi> which when I have touched upon one or two obſervations from theſe laſt words, I ſhall without any other interruption fall upon. The Obſervations are theſe:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Is heaven ſhut by theſe Witneſſes, ſo <hi>that no rain</hi> falls upon the Antichriſtian party, all the glad tydings of forgiveneſſe, and reconciliation withheld from them? How ſad muſt needs be the condition of ſuch a people? What have they to ſoften them, to make them fruitfull, when no rain at all falls upon them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. How fruitfull on the contrary ſhould we be, who live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the droppings of heaven, and are refreſhed with the former, and latter rain alwayes in their ſeaſons? Poor Papiſts have no <hi>rain:</hi> Yea, how much the rather ſhould we endeavour fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, <note place="margin">Iſa. 5. 5, 6.</note> leſt for default, that ſame be made good upon us, which once the Lord threatned, his Vineyard withall, <hi>he would tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>away the hedge, and would command the clouds, that they ſhould rain no rain upon it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Do the Witneſſes pour forth all the Vials? No marvell then, they are ſaid <hi>to torment them thot dwell upon the earth;</hi> No <note place="margin">Verſ. 10.</note> marvell, thoſe ſame Inhabitants of the earth <hi>rejoyce, they are got rid of them,</hi> as they do, when by the hands of theſe Witneſſes, is emptied forth ſo much wrath upon them.</p>

               <p>This much in the groſſe, but look more particularly, and you ſhall finde in what is mentioned of theſe Witneſſes ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, ſuch ſpecialls obſervable as theſe;</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is <hi>warre waged</hi> with theſe witneſſes, and the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent the Witneſſes <hi>overcome, and killed.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>time</hi> when this warre is waged, and theſe witneſſes overcome, and killed by this beaſt, and this is (ſayes the Text) <hi>when they have finiſhed their teſtimony.</hi> I ſhall addreſſe my ſelf to ſpeak of theſe in this order: Firſt, the warre waged and the conſequents, then that which follows in the order above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
               <p>And for this <hi>warre</hi> waged with theſe Witneſſes, we muſt not think this is the firſt, which hath ever been raiſed againſt them: as though the Witneſſes, had met with no oppoſings, all the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:111659:16"/> time of their propheſie (continuing ſo many hundred yeers) till juſt toward the end, and cloſe of it, we muſt not ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive at any hand: For if you conſult, the thirteenth Chapter, and ſeventh verſe, you finde the beaſt (theſe Witneſſes enemy, and as old, as are theſe Witneſſes) ſo ſoon almoſt as he receives being, receives <hi>power to make warre with the Saints, and to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Cha. 13. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>and kill them.</hi> And in the twelfth Chapter and laſt verſe, the <hi>Dragon</hi> who ſubſtitutes this beaſt, and on whom he eſtates <hi>his power, throne, and great authority</hi> (himſelf being now no longer able to hold them in his own name) as ſoon as ever the Woman was <hi>ſcaped into the wilderneſſe,</hi> which is now ſeverall hundred yeers agone, he goes forth under covert of this beaſt, <hi>To make warre with the remnant of her ſeed, which kept the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Chapl 12. Verſ. ult.</note> 
                  <hi>Commandments of God, and had the testimony of JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſure the event ſhews as much, when above four hundred yeers agone, in that one Kingdom of <hi>Gaule</hi> (now called <hi>France)</hi> if <hi>Perionius</hi> may be beleeved, at leaſt ten hundred thouſand of thoſe godly <hi>Waldenſes</hi> and <hi>Albigenſes</hi> were butchered by this beaſt. And can we imagine ſo many Saints ſlain, and none of theſe Witneſſes among all theſe numbers?</p>
               <p>This warre then here mentioned, ſuppoſes not the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes <hi>untouched</hi> all the time of their propheſie before, but rather ſeemes to hold forth ſome <hi>eminent warre,</hi> now at laſt to be raiſed againſt them; which perhaps, becauſe it ſhall differ from all the former in the <hi>quality</hi> of it, or ſpecially in the <hi>ſucceſſe,</hi> ſtriking of all the Witneſſes there, where 'tis done, which no other warre had perhaps done before, is therefore by the Holy Ghoſt thought fit onely to be mentioned.</p>
               <p>Nor yet therefore can we ſay this warre ſhall be more <hi>grievous</hi> and <hi>bloudy</hi> then all the former, poſſibly it is not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned for any eminent bloudſhed accompanying it, but rather (as ſome conceive) for a ſigne of the inſtant, and neer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching ruine of Antichriſt, which but a little after follows it however; I dare not ſay this laſt warre, ſhall be eminent for bloudſhed beyond all the former, for this reaſon I now offer. If this ſame killing of theſe Witneſſes can not be
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:111659:16"/> underſtood in the Letter, <hi>viz.</hi> That indeed, and in the Letter theſe Witneſſes ſhould be ſlain, but a myſticall killing is only here underſtood; then ſure this cannot be a killing ſo very bloudy: But that this muſt be underſtood not of a <hi>reall</hi> killing, but a <hi>mysticall</hi> hence appeares: Such as is the <hi>reſurrection</hi> of theſe Witneſſes mentioned at the eleventh Verſe, ſuch muſt needs be the <hi>killing,</hi> here mentioned, for of <hi>oppoſites there is the ſame reaſon.</hi> But their reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection <note place="margin">Oppoſitorum eademratio.</note> we muſt needs underſtand myſtically, for of no reſurrection properly ſo called, do we read before the twentieth Chapter of this propheſie, which muſt neceſſarily <note place="margin">Cha. 20. 5.</note> follow ſome ſpace the riſing again of theſe Witneſſes here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
               <p>This then is a myſticall killing, a throwing them from place, out of office, ſome civill death: As when a man in place formerly, now thrown out, may be ſaid to be killed in his office, is dead in law: So theſe, ceaſing from place in Church, and Commonwealth, which as Magiſtrates and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, they ſometimes enjoyed, and this accompanied perhaps with the killing of ſome of them indeed; this ſeems the <hi>killing of the Witneſſes,</hi> we are to underſtand here.</p>
               <p>I ſay again the <hi>killing of theſe Witneſſes</hi> by this reckoning, ſeems no other, then <hi>the throwing them from that ſtation, which once they held in the Reformed Churches, being taken off from executing that Magistracie, that Miniſtry they once had; and this poſſibly attended with the reall ſlaughter of ſome of them,</hi> Though the other, the killing of them in their office, ſeem the main, and more generall ſlaughter here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
               <p>Having ſeen whats done to theſe Witneſſes, <hi>[They are ſlain]</hi> we next enquire <hi>who ſlayes them,</hi> and to this the Text makes anſwer, <hi>The beaſt that aſcendeth out of the bottomleſſe pit:</hi> this now next in order comes to be handled.</p>
               <p>For this therefore you may take notice, there is a ſeverall <note place="margin">Chap. 4. Verſ. 6, 7, 8, 9. Chap. 13. Verſ. 1. &amp; 11.</note> mention made of <hi>beaſts</hi> in this propheſie; in the fourth Chapter you have four <hi>beaſts</hi> ſpoken of, in the thirteenth Chapter theres mention made of <hi>two; one with two horns,</hi> another <hi>with tenne:</hi> But no where doe we finde a <hi>beaſt aſcending out of the</hi>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:111659:17"/> 
                  <hi>bottomleſſe pit,</hi> this character being expreſly affixed, ſave onely in the 17 Chapter of this Propheſie, whitherto having recourſe <note place="margin">Cha. 17. 8.</note> (where the holy Ghoſt ſeems not more to <hi>propheſie,</hi> then <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret)</hi> we ſhall beſt finde what's meant by the <hi>beaſts aſcending out of the bottoml<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſſe pit</hi> here mentioned, and ſo in concluſion who it is that doth ſlay theſe Witneſſes.</p>
               <p>In that 17 Chapter therefore you have a woman preſented ſitting upon a <hi>Scarlet-coloured beaſt, having ſeven heads and ten</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Verſ. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>horns.</hi> In the opening whereof, the <hi>woman</hi> is expreſly by the holy Ghoſt called, <hi>The great City which ruleth over the Kings of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Verſ. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>the earth;</hi> that is, <hi>Rome;</hi> for at that time <hi>Rome</hi> onely of all the Cities of the world, was capable of any ſuch deſcription; and if ſo, the <hi>Woman</hi> be <hi>Rome,</hi> it muſt needs follow the <hi>Beaſt</hi> ſhe ſits upon muſt be the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> this follows ſo cleer from the former, none needs to make queſtion of it.</p>
               <p>But becauſe the Roman Empire in its Bulk conſidered, and according to its <hi>materiale,</hi> doth no more aſcend out of <hi>the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſſe pit</hi> then other Empires and Kingdomes do; to looſe this knot, hear a little further: The holy Ghoſt ſhewing the myſtery of the <hi>ſeven heads, and ten horns,</hi> tells us, The <hi>ſeven</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Verſ. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>heads</hi> are <hi>ſeven Kings,</hi> or <hi>ſeven kindes of Government, five</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, namely, That of <hi>Kings, Conſuls, Tribunes, Decemviri,</hi> and <hi>Dictators,</hi> were expired already; <hi>one,</hi> namely, That of <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars, was,</hi> it <hi>was</hi> when <hi>John</hi> ſaw this Viſion; and the <hi>ſeventh,</hi> that of <hi>Popes,</hi> was <hi>to come;</hi> and when it <hi>comes, this kinde of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Verſ 8.</note> 
                  <hi>was to aſcend out of the bottomleſſe pit.</hi> So that by this account, not ſo much the <hi>Empire, the body of the Beaſt,</hi> as the <hi>ſeventh head of this Beaſt, comes out of the bottomleſſe pit;</hi> or elſe thus, The Empire, as ruled by the Popes, and thus caſt into an Antichriſtian Form, <hi>this is the Beaſt aſcending out of the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe pit; The Roman Empire Antichriſtianized, is the Beaſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending out of the bottomleſſe pit ſlaying theſe Witneſſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But why is this kinde of Government ſaid to <hi>aſcend out of the bottomleſſe pit?</hi> I was once thinking the ſame thing meant by this expreſſion, as by the ſame Beaſt's <hi>aſcending out of the Sea,</hi> at the 13 Chapter and 1 Verſe; which <hi>Sea</hi> is frequently in Scripture called the <hi>Abyſſe,</hi> or <hi>bottomleſſe pit;</hi> and there, as in other places, ſignifies no more then a <hi>multitude of people,</hi> which becauſe ſubjecting themſelves to the Government of this Beaſt,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:111659:17"/> thence is this Beaſt ſaid to <hi>riſe out of the Sea.</hi> But when I finde that none of all the former <hi>heads</hi> but might in this ſenſe be ſaid to <hi>aſcend out of the bottomleſſe pit;</hi> namely, Becauſe ariſing from the multitude of people ſubjecting themſelves to them, and yet finde none of them ſaid <hi>to riſe out of the bottomleſſe pit,</hi> ſave this <hi>laſt,</hi> this of <hi>Popes</hi> onely, it cleerly to me holds forth thus much. The other kindes of Government, ſhadowed out by the former heads, had ſomewhat of God in them. at worſt were but the Ordinances of men; but this ſeventh head, this Government of Popes, this hath its originall from hell, its <hi>coming,</hi> as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaks, is <hi>after the working of Sathan,</hi> 'tis his diviſing, <note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 2. 9.</note> comes from the <hi>bottomleſſe pit,</hi> and ſhall in due time be ſent thither back again.</p>
               <p>So that adde this to the former, and the Romane Empire un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſeventh head, namely, that of Popes (a Government de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed, <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>You have ſeen then the enemy that wages War with theſe Witneſſes, and ſlayes them; the next thing we are to enquire, is the time <hi>when theſe Witneſſes are ſlain,</hi> and this is then <hi>when they have finiſhed their testimony;</hi> this now follows to be enquired concerning.</p>
               <p>I finde this [<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

               <p>So that putting all together, <hi>viz. Their killing, The beaſt that kills them, and The time when they are killed;</hi> and you have the meaning of all at one view thus much:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then when the Witneſſes are about to cloſe up their teſtimony, and having done much in reforming the Church, having regained much of the utter Court, which Antichriſt had gained whole poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion</hi>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:111659:18"/> 
                  <hi>of before, are now about to put off their Sackcloth, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian power, at this time collecting it ſelf, poſſibly by mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering ſome, but chiefly by putting them from their places, diſina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, ſuſpending, and ſilencing, ſhall thus overcome, kill, and make an end of theſe Witneſſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now perhaps it will be expected, eſpecially having ſo fair a hint given by the Text; we ſhould come to ſome determination <hi>Whether the killing of theſe Witneſſes be paſt yea or no;</hi> but in regard we ſhall be furniſhed with moſt light then when we have heard the Propheſie ſpeak out, we ſhall therefore adjourn the deciſion till the laſt, ſtill continuing to proceed forward in opening the Propheſie; onely before we do proceed any further from this laſt verſe, we now opened, take theſe obſervations:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Are the Witneſſes ſlain when they have done their teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony? Hence take notice, Beſt men, and beſt Offices, are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time of all other the worſt rewarded: here are Witneſſes, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſinners home from dangerous and periſhing wayes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching them to turn from <hi>dumb Idols, to ſerve the living God,</hi> then which none can do a better Office, yet after all their pains beſtowed, they are killed for a recompence.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Are theſe ſlain then when their mouths are ſtopped, when they ceaſe to witneſſe? By this account men live no longer then they work; and whoſo hath left off to do the Lords work, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks in another caſe, <hi>is dead while he lives;</hi> he that <note place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 6. Rev. 14. 13</note> hath <hi>reſted from his labour,</hi> by this reckoning is no other then dead.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Doth the <hi>Beaſt</hi> ſlay theſe Witneſſes? Oh the plague this <hi>Beaſt,</hi> this <hi>Antichriſt</hi> is to the world! but two lights leading a blinde world from perdition, and the Antichriſtian power puts them both out, <hi>ſlayes both the Witneſſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Doth the <hi>Beaſt</hi> aſcend out of the bottomleſſe pit, the Antichriſtian kinde of Government, aſcend out of hell? ſure then they much miſtake themſelves that tell us 'tis <hi>jure divino:</hi> they much miſtake its originall, that tell us it is from heaven: 'tis from hell, from the bottomleſſe pit, if we believe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; there it had its conception, and ſhall in due time be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned thither back again.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The ſlaughter of theſe Witneſſes being for the moſt part an <hi>unbloody</hi> ſlaughter, the killing of them in their Office, as we ſaw before, by the like proportion; their <hi>lying d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

They remaining ſuſpended from the execution of that Office which as Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates and Miniſters they held before, remaining ſilent, not propheſying, not witneſſing any thing authoritatively as they did formerly; this ſeems meant by the Witneſſes <hi>lying dead.</hi> I ſay again, Their mouthes were ſtopt at what time they were ſlain, and ſince then they continue ſilent, dead to all that life which as the Lords Prophets and Witneſſes they lived before; thus they <hi>lie for ſome ſpace as dead corpſes after their ſlaughter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But paſſing from this, let's take a view of the place where theſe Witneſſes lie dead, this follows, and 'tis <hi>[In the ſtreet of the great City, ſpiritually called</hi> Sodom, <hi>and</hi> Egypt, <hi>where alſo our Lord was crucified.]</hi>

               <p>A <hi>place</hi> ſo at large ſet forth, and by ſuch apt reſemblances, as indeed it ſeems even next door to naming it; in the deſcription whereof, the holy Ghoſt beſtows ſo many words, that when he wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This place, becauſe it will afford much variety of matter not unprofitable, we ſhall therefore take a more exact view of it, enquiring, firſt, What this <hi>great City</hi> is? Then, what the <hi>ſtreet?</hi> Why this <hi>great City</hi> is called <hi>Sodom?</hi> Why <hi>Egypt?</hi> Why <hi>the place where our Lord was crucified?</hi>

               <p>For the firſt of theſe; Whereas it is ſaid the dead bodies of

               <p>But this is not all; As <hi>Egypt</hi> was an <hi>Idolatrous</hi> place, ſo was it to the people of God, a place of <hi>cruelties,</hi> it was to them the houſe of <hi>Iron bondage.</hi> However it was friendly at firſt, yet <note place="margin">Deu 4. 20.

               </p>
               <p>The enquiry of the meaning of this, is our preſent buſineſſe: In the endeavour whereof, for better order ſake, we ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve:</p>
               <p n="1">1. What it is that's further done to theſe Witneſſes after they are ſlain; In theſe words [They are looked upon, and not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to be put in graves.]</p>
               <p n="2">2. The perſons that look upon them, and will not ſuffer them them to be put in graves, pointed at in theſe words, <hi>[They of the People, and Kinreds, and Tongues, and Nations]</hi> theſe look upon the dead Witneſſes, and will not ſuffer them to be put in graves.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

               </p>
               <p>In the foremoſt of theſe (which will perhaps take in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond in the ſcanning) I muſt needs acknowledge there is a knot; which becauſe it ſeems to lay it ſelf open to two, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, and oppoſite meanings, and both very plauſible, renders the matter difficult whether to take of them.</p>
               <p>The queſtion is, Whether this [looking upon theſe dead Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and the not ſuffering them to be put in graves,] be done in favour, or diſ-favour of them; and accordingly as you incline in this queſtion either to the one ſide, or to the other, ſo will there a ſutable meaning offer it ſelf to you. To inſtance therefore; here's one interpretation the words ſeem to like of. The Beaſt, the Romiſh Antichriſt with his complices, having ſtopped the mouthes of all the Witneſſes, <hi>thus ſlaying them,</hi> and now fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deviſing ſome way, that being thus ſlain, they may never riſe again, never witneſſe more againſt him, <hi>thus trying to throw them into the Grave, to ſhut and ſeal the graves-mouth upon them;</hi> in attempting hereof, is by the Reformed people (through the Miniſtry of the Witneſſes, by this time grown into great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes, and already provoked for the ſlaughter of theſe Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:111659:23"/> fits down content onely to have thruſt theſe Witneſſes from their places, and ſtopt their mouths for preſent, not daring to make any further attempt at all againſt them. Thus they of the Kinreds, and Tongues, and People, and Nations, do hinder, that Antichriſt (who hath ſlain theſe Witneſſes) ſhould yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed ſo far as to throw them into graves; And to this interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation theſe Conſiderations ſeem to give countenance:</p>
               <p>1. It is not the <hi>Inhabitants of the earth</hi> (by which name the Popiſh faction are commonly known in this <hi>Revelation)</hi> who keep the Witneſſes from being buried; for then the matter had been put beſides all queſtion; but on the contrary, tis [They of the Kinreds, and Tongues, and People, and Nations] theſe will not ſuffer the Witneſſes to be put in graves; by which, who can be meant but the <hi>Reform<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>? Thoſe</hi> you have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed brought in rejoycing, at the following Verſe, for the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">Verſ. 10.</note> of the Witneſſes; <hi>who,</hi> had they been here meant alſo, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably not this ſo different, but the ſame expreſſion had ſerv'd to point at them in both places.</p>
               <p>2. The Originall Text ſeems to contribute ſomething toward this Interpretation; where you reade, [<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] being all put <hi>partitively;</hi> As if the holy Ghoſt ſhould ſay; [And ſome of them of the Kinreds, and People, and Tongues, &amp;c. ſome of finer mettle, choyce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> ſpirits] theſe ſhall not ſuffer the Witneſſes to be put in graves.</p>
               <p>2. This is one Interpretation, and indeed in the generall plauſible, though (I muſt confeſſe) looking a little neerer, to ſee how particulars will hold, there ſeems ſome difficulty: For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; ſtating the Reformed people <hi>k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>p the Witneſſes from bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> but what can be meant by <hi>their looking on their dead bodies?</hi> (ſo ſayes the Text) <hi>They look upon their dead bodies three dayes and an holy;</hi> Is it any pleaſure for them to have their eyes ſo long upon their dead Witneſſes? <hi>Abraham,</hi> when his beloved <hi>Sarah</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 23. 4.</note> was dead, then buyes a place to <hi>bury his dead out of his ſight:</hi> were it never ſo great delight to look on them while alive, ſure it can be none to look on them when dead. And then again, what can we underſtand by thoſe <hi>graves,</hi> which according to this Interpretation, the Reformed people are ſaid not to ſuffer theſe Witneſſes to be put into? ſhall we ſay this they mean, [they keep them from being killed indeed] but where finde we
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:111659:23"/> that [not ſuffering to be buried] ſhould mean, not [ſuffering to be killed] what analogie between theſe? And indeed 'tis a hard matter to aſſign any condition which holds reſemblance, or analogie with thoſe <hi>graves,</hi> which the Reformed people (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this Interpretation) are ſaid to keep the dead Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes from.</p>
               <p>So you have the firſt meaning the words ſeem to allow of; The other is this:</p>
               <p>The Romiſh Antichriſt with his party, having ſtopped the mouthes of theſe Witneſſes, thus ſlaying them, after this ſhall with ſcorn, and inſultation look upon their dead bodies: And if any ſhould come as <hi>Joſeph of Arimathea,</hi> to beg the body of <note place="margin">Joh. 13. 39</note> one of theſe dead Witneſſes, or ſhould trie to hide or ſhelter theſe <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> as <hi>Obadiah</hi> did the <hi>Prophets in the Cave;</hi> no, they <note place="margin">1 Kin. 18. 4 and 13.</note> muſt not; ſuch is the ſavageneſſe of this Beaſt, with his compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they forbid any to harbour, entertain or countenance theſe ſilenc'd Witneſſes, thus <hi>not ſuffering their dead bodies to be put in graves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if this ſenſe ſhall paſſe, then have we a fair and obvious underſtanding of both thoſe particulars, which in the former we ſcarce knew what at all to make of. The former [They look upon them] according to this Interpretation, the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing muſt be, [They look upon them in deriſion.] So they did upon our Saviour, when he was upon the Croſſe; <hi>The people, with the Prieſts, beholding of him, derided him, Luk.</hi> 23. 25. And is it not an uſuall thing, in this manner for them to be <hi>looked upon,</hi> who having been formidable before, are now brought down, and become at an under? Caſt your eye upon that 14 of <hi>Iſa.</hi> and 16, and you will thence eaſily know, what it is for any <note place="margin">Iſa. 14. 10. and 16.</note> to be looked upon in the caſe above mentioned; Obſerve the words a little, [They that ſee thee, ſhall narrowly look upon thee] Mark you, Here's a <hi>looking upon</hi> the Babylonian Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs now fallen; well, and what ſay they? <hi>Is this the man that made the earth to tremble, that did ſhake Kingdoms? Art thou alſo become weak as one of us?</hi> See how they inſult over that fallen Monarchy.</p>
               <p>And then for their [not ſuffering them to be put in graves] which was the other expreſſion, we knew not what to make of in the former Interpretation (ſtill retaining the analogie)
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:111659:24"/> it hath this meaning, [They ſhall deny them ſhelter, hiding place, and the like] So that if any had a deſire to entertain them into their houſes, ſo to <hi>bury</hi> them within their private Walls, it muſt not be: The Beaſt will not allow ſo much honour done to theſe Witneſſes, as to <hi>ſuffer their dead bodies to be put in graves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In both which, there ſeems an alluſion to our Saviours caſe, juſt after he was crucified; whoſe dead body was indeed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon <hi>Joſeph of Arimathea,</hi> when he came to beg it, but had it not been becauſe the next day was <hi>a high day</hi> with the <note place="margin">Joh. 19 31.</note> Jews, it had hung a longer ſpace upon the Croſſe, to be the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the gaze, and ſcorn of all that ſhould paſſe by. But theſe more cruell then the Jews, at leaſt not fearing their <hi>Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Verſ. 10.</note> (mentioned in the Verſe following) ſhould be prophaned by the bodies of the Witneſſes lying unburied in the ſtreet, will not at any hand ſuffer them to be put in graves; but there they muſt lie to be looked upon, the ſcorn and deriſion of all; as our Saviours had been alſo, had not the ſolemnity of the day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prevented.</p>
               <p>And now to render this Interpretation more likely, take theſe Conſiderations:</p>
               <p n="1">1. To deny the dead buriall, ſounds alwayes a diſ-favour; a great diſ-favour from him that doth deny it; a great indignity to him to whom it is denyed: was it no indignity to <hi>Jehoiakim,</hi> that he is threatned to be <hi>buried with the buriall of an Aſſe?</hi> He <note place="margin">Jer 22. 19.</note> ſhould have no buriall at all, or none worth having? As alſo to the Babylonian Monarchs, That they ſhould be <hi>caſt out of their graves, as an abominable branch?</hi> Would this be no indignity, no <note place="margin">Iſa. 14. 19.</note> diſ-favour to them?</p>
               <p n="2">2. That which appears the main ſupport of the other Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation (namely, becauſe 'tis not <hi>the inhabitants of the earth are ſaid to keep them from their graves,</hi> but <hi>The Kinreds, and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and Tongues, and Nations;</hi> implying thereby, That not the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Party do it, but ſome other) will not hold; both (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the different expreſſion) ſeeming indeed to mean the ſame perſons. They do ſo at the 13 Chap. of this Propheſie, the 7 &amp; 8 V. In the former whereof, I mean the 7. you find the <hi>Beaſt hath power given him, over all Kinreds, and Tongues, &amp; People, and Nations:</hi> In the latter, <hi>All that dwell upon the earth worſhip him.</hi> Here they are all one: But now if any man ſhould queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <p>You have now both the Interpretations. The one under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this [looking upon the Witneſſes, and not ſuffering them to be put in graves] done in favour to them, the other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favour: neither of them unlikely, and therefore I ſhall leave every one, after the reaſons on both ſides well weighed, to take which himſelf beſt pleaſes; though for my own part I muſt confeſſe I rather encline to this latter, 'Tis done in diſ-favour.</p>
               <p>And now you ſee this large handling of the firſt thing menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned; namely, [the looking upon the Witneſſes, and not ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to be put in graves] hath (according to our former

               <p>For if ſo be theſe Witneſſes are kept out of their gaves in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to them, according as the former meaning would have it, then [they of the Kinreds, and Tongues, and Nations] muſt needs be the <hi>Reformed people;</hi> but if this be done in diſ-favour, as the ſecond Interpretation carries it, then muſt [they of the Kinreds and People, and Tongues and Nations] without all controverſie mean the <hi>Popiſh Party.</hi>

               <p>Concerning which <hi>three dayes and an half,</hi> I ſhall not ſay as ſome do, it ſignifies ſome very ſhort time, yet not at all limited, <note place="margin">Paraeus Com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The meaning of this Verſe, and all the ſeveralls thereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus at large opened; I ſhall not for this once, draw up the ſumme of all offering it to one view, ſo (as hath been my former manner) but ſtudious of brevity, ſhall forthwith pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the obſervations, which are theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From the former Interpretation; Do the reformed peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple keep the Witneſſes from being thrown in to graves? Then if this ſhould not be paſt, here is a leſſon for the reformed peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, here's this hint for them: Though they may ſuffer Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:111659:26"/> to ſlay their Witneſſes; yet when he goes about to throw them into the grave, to the end they might never riſe again, then does it behove the reformed people, with all their united ſtrength, reſolvedly to oppoſe it.</p>
               <p>Let the reformed people remember this, now they are told of it, if ſuch a thing were yet to be accompliſhed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That they do their parts, and not ſuffer Antichriſt, after he hath ſlain their Witneſſes, to the end they might never riſe again, to throw them into the grave alſo.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From the latter. 1. Do the Popiſh party look upon the dead Witneſſes, and will not ſuffer them to be buried, that they might ſtill delight themſelves in the beholding of them? Oh the inſinite ſpleen the Popiſh party do bear againſt the Lords Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes! Is it not ſufficient, they have ſlain them, but they muſt have their dead bodies lye before them, to ſcorn and mock at? Is it not ſufficient, <hi>the Philiſtimes have put out Sampſons cyes,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Jud. 16. 21<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and 25.</note> but they muſt ſend for him in this condition, <hi>to make them ſport alſo?</hi> Take notice of the immortall hate theſe bear againſt Gods Witneſſes, which doth not determine with their death; For after this, they muſt have their dead bodies to make may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>games of.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Obſerve the ſalvageneſſe of Antichriſt and his crew, who will not ſuffer the dead Witneſſes to have the honour of buriall: When they have ſtopped the Witneſſes mouths, and ſo ſlain them, they cannot bear it, that any ſhall take a ſilenced Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe into houſe, give him ſhelter, entertainment: Hence ſuch ſearch, ſuch enquiry made after theſe proſcribed Witneſſes here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, and ſhould this not be accompliſhed, it will be greater yet then ever, the Antichriſtian party will not ſuffer the dead Witneſſes to be put in graves.</p>

               <p>But ſufficient of this <hi>firſt thing,</hi> I mean <hi>the riſing again of the Witneſſes;</hi> now follows the ſecond, <hi>the time when they riſe again;</hi> [After three dayes and an half, that is, after three yeers and an half] which becauſe it hath already in the foregoing words been handled, I ſhall paſſe from it to the <hi>third thing, viz.</hi> [The conſequent of this Reſurrection] in theſe words; <hi>Great fear fell upon them which ſaw them.</hi>

               <p>But you will not blame the beholders here to be afraid at the riſing again of theſe <hi>Witneſſes:</hi> For if theſe be the Popiſh par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as was conceived they well might be; did they ever dream they ſhould ſee the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> riſe again; did not they think they had made ſuch ſure work, as that they ſhould never have been troubled with them any more; but now after they had ſlain them, that beſides all expectation they ſhould riſe again, and this perhaps to torment them worſe then ever they did before, can you blame them they are afraid at it?</p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:111659:32"/>
               <p>We have now examined all the ſeveralls of this verſe, all which drawn together, are thus much in the reſult; The <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes</hi> being ſilenced, thruſt from their places, thus ſlain, after three yeers and an half are by a ſpeciall hand of God reſtored to liberty and office again; at which the Antichriſtian faction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come greatly afraid, not having the leaſt thought, after they had once ſlain the <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> they ſhould ever have been troubled, or tormented with them any more.</p>
               <p>Having thus opened the words, there are but two Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons I ſhall make from them, and then paſse on to what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes.</p>

               <p>This Aſcenſion, and ſo the ſeveralls thereto appertaining, are not to be underſtood in the letter, as though the Witneſſes after their Reſurrection, ſhould now indeed, and in the letter aſcend up to heaven; by no means, it ſeems at no hand to be imagined.</p>
               <p>But (as we ſhewed) their death was a myſticall death, their Reſurrection a myſticall Reſurrection; ſo now in like manner we ſay their Aſcenſion muſt be a myſticall Aſcenſion alſo.

               <p>But what voice is it then theſe Witneſſes hear, calling them up to heaven. I anſwer, If it muſt be a myſticall voyce (as we ſaid before) what more likely thing can it be, then ſome <hi>Act,</hi> ſome <hi>Decree</hi> of them in high place, calling theſe Witneſſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome more free, and honourable condition, oppoſite to that of Sackcloth, wherein the Antichriſtian faction made them propheſie before.</p>
               <p>I ſay again, Some <hi>Act</hi> or <hi>Decree,</hi> this ſeems to be the voyce.] And then ſuch as are in authority, appertaining to the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches, which are often ſo expreſſed, ſeem to be the [Heaven,] from whence this great voyce comes. And that this voyce bidding them aſcend up thither, may very well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>token an invitation to ſome more ample and honourable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, let but this be conſidered, <hi>viz.</hi> That when theſe Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes roſe up again, they roſe up into their propheticall office, by vertue of their reſurrection, they had a liberty to Propheſie again: and then after this, To be called up to Heaven, what can it be, but ſome more <hi>liberall condition</hi> offered to them, then that wherein they witneſſed againſt Antichriſt before? So that by this reckoning, by their <hi>Reſurrection</hi> they gain their mouths open to <hi>Propheſie again,</hi> by their <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> they gain it be not in <hi>Sackcloth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their <hi>Aſcenſion it ſelf,</hi> next follows, [They aſcended up to Heaven.] And what can this mean, anſwerable to the former, but this, <hi>viz.</hi> They had that honour put upon them, which by the voyce from Heaven they were called to? They have now their Sackcloth taken from them, neither themſelves, nor their Miniſtry, either to be ſo contemned, or perſecuted as before.

In ſumme, what you can conceive, is properly oppoſite to Sackcloth, as cleering them in the eye of the world, mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, eſteem, and the like, <hi>This is the Witneſſes aſcending up to heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo ſometime <hi>[Aſcending up to heaven]</hi> ſignifies: I mean a greater acceſſion of honour, and dignity.

               <p>I do not finde Interpreters go thus particularly to work, thinking perhaps (as the ſaying is, Gold is not under every ſtone.) I mean, That every word ſhall have ſomething of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in it; but perhaps it would not have given ſatisfaction, had I paſſed this ſame without this particular examination: but how likely this is the cloud wherein theſe Witneſſes aſcend up to heaven, I ſhall leave every one to judge, and from it paſſe on to the Concomitants of this aſcention, the former where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is laid down in theſe words. And their enemies beheld them.</p>
               <p>Their enemies.] Who can theſe be, but the Antichriſtian faction? Whom can we imagine enemies to theſe Witneſſes, but they?</p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:111659:34"/>
               <p>Theſe behold them.] And with how much terrour, with how much inward torment, and vexation? When they roſe again in the former verſe, you ſee what impreſſions of fear it then made upon them, <hi>The Witneſſes ſtand upon their feet</hi> (ſay thoſe words,) <hi>and great fedr fell on them which ſaw them:</hi> Even juſt ſo it was with <hi>Herod,</hi> when he thought <hi>John the Baptist,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 13.</note> (whom he beheaded) was riſen from the dead: And no marvell they are put into this fright, upon the riſing again of theſe Witneſſes: For the Popiſh faction to ſee them riſe again whom they had ſlain once, they then conceiving they had made ſuch a hand with theſe Witneſſes, as they ſhould never be troubled with them any more; can you blame them they are afraid at it?</p>
               <p>But further, That after their riſing again, they ſhould now aſcend up to heaven alſo; what fear, what indignation, will this impreſſe upon them? What fear? Had they, but only riſen again, they might have hoped again to have ſlain them; but now to aſcend up to heaven alſo, ſo as they could not reach them, ſo as they could not ſlay them any more: where they ſhould ſit ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, and out of their danger, they thence a new tormenting them, as for their former wrongs, ſo for their late killing of them; and this with much more grievous torment, their little finger being now made heavier, then their whole loynes were before; Can we thinke, but this ſhould much encreaſe the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour formerly falling on them upon the riſing again of theſe Witneſſes.</p>
               <p>And as adde to their fear, ſo beget in them much bitter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation. To ſee thoſe whom they accounted not worthy to breath in the air while alive, nor worthy the honour of a grave when dead; not only to riſe again, but to aſcend up to heaven alſo, to be followed with ſhoutings, and acclamations, have their Sackcloth taken off, and the <hi>Germent of gladneſſe,</hi> and honour inſtead thereof put upon them: How think we, is not this enough to make the Antichriſtian party, even eat their hearts for ſpight and indignation, and wiſh their eye-balls ſunk in their heads, rather then to behold it. <hi>The Witneſſes aſcend up to heaven, and their enemies behold them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Put all together now, and the ſumme of all theſe ſeveralls is this much, After that the Witneſſes are by a ſpeciall hand of God reſtored to office again, have their mouths open, which is

               <p>Beſides this there is a <hi>myſticall earthquake,</hi> when there are great ſtirs and commotions in Kingdoms and States, and by theſe the Forms of Government changed. Such earthquakes are thoſe mentioned at the 8 Chapter of this propheſie and 5 verſe; and 16 Chapter, and 18 verſe. And (if I miſtake not) where we finde mention of an earthquake in all this book, we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it to be a <hi>myſticall earthquake.</hi> such is the great earthquake here mentioned, a myſticall earthquake, a State-quake, a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom-quake; this ſeems the great earthquake here intended: When therefore the holy Ghoſt tells us, <hi>The ſame hour there was a great earthquake,</hi> 'tis this in effect; About the time of the riſing again, and Aſcenſion of theſe Witneſſes, there are great State and Kingdom-ſhakings.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Conſequents</hi> of this earthquake next follow, in theſe words; <hi>The tenth part of the City fell, and in the earthquake were ſlain of men ſeven thouſand; And the remnant were terrified, and gave glory to the God of heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which Conſequents if you take them aſunder, are three, as was before hinted. 1. <hi>The tenth part of the City falls.</hi> 2. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thouſand men ſlain.</hi> 3. <hi>The remnant are terrified, and give glory to the God of heaven.</hi> Of theſe in this order; 1.

               <p>This, I confeſſe, is a pretty Notion, but yet ſuch as I durſt in no wiſe conclude is the meaning of the holy Ghoſt in this place: It carries with it too much acuteneſſe to be the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Spirit; and indeed it ſeems too much forced alſo; That <hi>the tenth part of the City,</hi> ſhould mean <hi>the whole City,</hi> the words ſeem not in any reaſonable congruity to admit of it.</p>

The fall of the tenth part of the City,</hi> we may proceed to the ſecond, in theſe words; <hi>And in the earthquake were ſlain of men ſeven thouſand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This follows, and this is not without its difficulties neither: Some reade, <hi>the heads of men</hi> that were ſlain were ſeven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand; but if we reckon by the pole, ſeven thouſand men num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred by the pole were ſlain, and no more, it will readily be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected; How can it be imagined the tenth part of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Kingdom ſhould fall, and yet but ſeven thouſand heads, or ſeven thouſand men reckoned by the Pole, ſlain and overwhelmed in ſo great a ruine? Seven thouſand, thus reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſeem not a number any whit proportionable. To which it may be anſwered; This number of ſeven thouſand, is a perfect number, and is here put, as in other places, not to ſignifie juſt ſo many, and no more, but rather a certain number, for an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, and may very well ſignifie a great many more then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely that number.</p>
               <p>But if this ſhould not paſſe, there is another Interpretation <note place="margin">

               <p>Sum up all this verſe now, and 'tis thus much: About the time theſe Witneſſes riſe again, and aſcend up to heaven, about this time there are great ſtirs and commotions, in ſome of thoſe ten Kingdoms, into which the Roman Empire, upon its fall, became divided. By means whereof, Antichriſtianiſme becomes utterly aboliſhed in one of thoſe ten Kingdoms: upon the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing whereof, many of note, and profeſſedly of the Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian faction, are thrown from all Authority and Place, as alſo that large maintenance which they had before; which the other people, cleaving faſt to them before, now beholding, and taking notice of the finger of God in it, confeſſe their former errour, ſtrike off from them, never to cleave to them any more.</p>
               <p>The Obſervations now follow:</p>
               <p n="1">1.

                  </gap>ve very injurious, if after keeping the matter in ſuſpence all this time, I ſhould not now at laſt (as <hi>Samſon</hi> once preſſed with <note place="margin">Judg. 16. 16, 17.</note> importunity) tell all my whole heart, and diſcover whatſoever light I have received in this buſineſſe.</p>
               <p>I ſhall therefore now cheerfully ſet upon it, in mannaging whereof, I ſhall not dare to be peremptory in any thing, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting that any ſhould be concluded by what is propounded, farther then drawn to it by the ſtrength of reaſon conſonant to Scripture; and if I miſtake, for who am I, but I ſhould, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in a matter ſo intricate, and perplex as this is, ſuch as are candid, and Chriſtian will paſſe it by being confident (which they may be) that upon diſcovery, I ſhall moſt readily recide from it.</p>
               <p>This premiſed, come we now a little neerer to our purpoſe, The great queſtion after all remains, <hi>Whether theſe Witneſſes are ſlain, yea or no;</hi> which once reſolved, accordingly we ſhall be
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:111659:42"/> better able to anſwer that common queſtion, almoſt in every ones mouth. What will become of us? What do you think of theſe times? The deſire to anſwer which, was one main reaſon why we undertook this Propheſie of the Witneſſes.</p>
               <p>And for our more orderly diſcuſſing of this queſtion, we ſhall firſt take a view of their ſeverall thoughts, that tell us this ſlaughter of the Witneſſes is paſt, and paſt a good while agone, and ſee if any of theſe will abide the tryall. If not, then further enquire, if any ſuch thing hath been done in theſe latter times, which may appear to be the killing of theſe Witneſſes, which if we finde not, the queſtion is then cleerly anſwered, the Witneſſes are not ſlain: If we can, then the Witneſſes are ſlain, That which every one of us would ſo fain have to be ſo.</p>
               <p>The ſeverall opinions that bear us in hand the Witneſſes are ſlain, and ſlain a good while agone, are ſuch as theſe: Some tell us this was done, when ſo many thouſands of thoſe poor men of <hi>Lions</hi> (commonly ſo called) were deſtroyed by the procurement of Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the eighth, about the yeer 1300. Others there are, that ſay, they were ſlain, when <hi>John Huſſe,</hi> and <hi>Jerome</hi> of <hi>Prague</hi> were burnt by the Councell of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> about the yeer 1418. Others making the <hi>two Testaments,</hi> the <hi>two Witneſſes,</hi> tell us this ſlaughter was then, when they of the <hi>Councell of Trent,</hi> took away the perfection and authority of the Scriptures from them, about the yeer one thouſand five hundred forty ſixe; neer which time alſo, <hi>Charls</hi> the fifth, then the Popes moſt ſtout Champion, did overthrow, and vanquiſh the ſtrength of the godly party, at that time with all their might contending againſt Antichriſt.</p>
               <p>Some referre this ſame to the Maſſacre of <hi>Paris,</hi> others to the troubles of <hi>Germany.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And indeed what place of the Weſtern world, but hath had ſome thing done in it, like a ſlaying of the Witneſſes; which perhaps is the ground, why ſome think this killing of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes muſt be done ſucceſſively, in one Kingdom after another, and no other certain, and determinate killing beſides this, to be expected; but of this perhaps more anon.</p>
               <p>Among all theſe opinions, for the Witneſſes being ſlain ſo long ago, I ſhall ſingle out that from all the others, which
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:111659:42"/> ſeems indeed the moſt likely of them all: I mean that which ayms it upon the <hi>Counſell of Trent,</hi> bringing this to the touch, which if it ſhall appear, is not the ſlaying of the Witneſſes, and this by any arguments, which ſhall as forceably come againſt the other alſo, (I mean that which makes it the ſame with the deſtroying of the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> as alſo the ſame with the burning of <hi>John Huſſe,</hi> and <hi>Jerome</hi> of <hi>Prague,)</hi> then this opinion falls, and with it, thoſe other alſo. And for the Maſſacre of <hi>Paris,</hi> the troubles of <hi>Germany,</hi> they are not ſo contended for by any, that we ſhould be at the trouble particularly to examine them.</p>
               <p>That this therefore cannot be the ſlaying of the Witneſſes, I mean that which was done againſt the Scriptures, and the godly, about the time of the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> (beſides the Arguments proving the Scriptures, are not the Witneſſes) ſeems evident thus:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of the Witneſſes, together with the <hi>Earth-quake</hi> thereto appertaining, bring in the <hi>ſeventh Trumpet,</hi> which appears from the 13. 14. and 15 Verſes of this Chapter, and the <hi>ſeventh Trumpet</hi> brings in the <hi>utter deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Antichriſt,</hi> as is evident from the 10 Chap. ver. 6, 7, where the Angel ſwears, That when the <hi>ſeventh Trumpet ſhall begin to blow, there ſhall be time no more,</hi> Antichriſts time ſhall then be no more: But now we do not ſee Antichriſt deſtroyed, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding an hundred yeers paſt, and gone ſince this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſlaughter, and riſing again of theſe Witneſſes. I ſay once more, the riſing again of the Witneſſes, brings in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Trumpet, utterly deſtroying Antichriſt, and here's a hundred yeers paſt, ſince tis ſaid theſe Witneſſes roſe again, and yet Antichriſt in ſtrength undeſtroyed at this day.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the Witneſſes muſt pour forth at leaſt <hi>two or three Vials</hi> before they be ſlain, then could they not be ſlain, about the time of the <hi>Trent</hi> Counſell, when 'tis confeſſed, That either none, or but one of the Vials, was then poured forth. The conſequent is cleer; and that at leaſt <hi>two, or three Vials</hi> muſt be poured forth, before they can be ſlain; hence appears, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, How are they ſaid, before they are ſlain, to <hi>torment them that dwell upon the earth,</hi> at the tenth verſe of this Chapter, and this (as we there ſhewed) by pouring forth the Vials.</p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:111659:43"/>
               <p>If any ſhall ſay, <hi>the tormenting</hi> there mentioned may mean onely the firſt Vial, and this will be granted was poured forth before, mark the inconventences by thus ſaying we run upon:</p>
               <p n="1">1. The term of the Beaſt his continuing, and of the Witneſſes propheſying in Sackeloth, beginning and ending at the ſame time (as is commonly believed) by this reckoning we leave the Beaſt the ſpace while ſix Vials are a pouring forth, after that the term of the Witneſſes Propheſie is paſt and ended.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If but one Vial be poured forth when they are ſlain, and the ſixth and ſeventh Vial fall neer their Reſurrection, which they do, what becomes of the ſecond, third, fourth, and fifth Vials, where finde we any room for them? they hereby become utterly excluded. To ſay they are poured forth in the three yeers and an half, betwixt the ſlaying and Reſurrection of the Witneſſes; ſure this time is too ſcant for four Vials to be pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forth in: And beſides, the Witneſſes (who as we have ſhewn formerly, do pour forth all the Vials) do lie dead during all that ſpace, and therefore thoſe Vials cannot then be poured forth.</p>
               <p>To gather up all this in brief. The Witneſſes torment the earth, with four or five Vials before they are ſlain (the ſixth and ſeventh Vial falling in with the time of their Reſurrection) and therefore that time wherein either none, or but one of the Vials was poured forth, as was the time of the <hi>Counſell</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> cannot be the time of the ſlaying of the Witneſſes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If the ſlaying and riſing again of the Witneſſes was then, Whence is it that ſince that time theſe Witneſſes have been ſo grievouſly perſecuted? how is it that ſince that time ſo many have continued to propheſie in Sackcloth? yea, ſo many have been ſilenc'd, and ſuſpended in this Kingdom, in other places? Had they been once ſlain, and riſen again, afterward they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie in Sackcloth no more, are ſlain no more: If they roſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain then, how is it that for a hundred yeers ſpace ſince that time, we have found them ſtill continuing to propheſie in Sackcloth?</p>
               <p n="4">4. If it can be cleared, that the <hi>one thouſand two hundred and threeſcore yeers</hi> (the term of the Witneſſes Propheſie) cannot begin ſo high as <hi>Conſtantine the Great,</hi> ſo as to end about the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:111659:43"/> time of the <hi>Councell of Trent</hi> (as thoſe that favour this opinion contend) but muſt begin after <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and ſo reach over the <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> neerer to our times, then the buſineſſe is at an end, there will be no further queſtion in this matter.</p>
               <p>To cleer this ſame therefore, and ſo I ſhall eſſay to ſhew you when this one thouſand two hundred and threeſcore yeers of the Witneſſes Propheſie doth begin (that which every one ſo greedily enquires after.) For this purpoſe, I muſt remember you of what I formerly hinted, namely, That the time of the Gentiles treading down the holy City; the time of the Beaſt his reigning, forty two moneths; the time of the woman in the Wilderneſſe, time, times, and half a time; and the time of the Witneſſes Propheſying in Sackcloth, a thouſand two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and threeſcore dayes, ſeem all of them to be the ſame time; ſo that if we can finde where any of theſe either begin or end we ſhall finde where every of them begin, and end alſo. This ſtated (which none need queſtion, proof being ſo obvious <note place="margin">Vid Mede. Clav. Apo. Napier Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raus.</note> to any that ſhall make enquiry, and which only for brevity ſake, I do not produce,) I ſay this granted. Let us eſſay to finde when the beaſt begins his forty two moneths, which ſeems eaſieſt of the reſt, and for our better direction, in this work, we ſhall make theſe enquiries.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. When the Beaſt had his <hi>deadly wound</hi> with the ſword, <note place="margin">Revel. 13. 4, 5.</note> and that <hi>healed</hi> up again; for from that time forward, the Beaſt hath power to continue forty and two moneths.</p>

It was the ſixth head ſtanding on, that hindered the riſing up, and appearance of the ſeventh: To make this more plain, conceive it all thus; The Roman Empire is preſented in this Propheſie as a Beaſt, with <note place="margin">Chap. 17. Verſe 3.</note> ſeven heads; which ſeven heads, are ſeven kinds of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, one in order ſucceeding an other. Five of theſe heads were gone, and the ſixth, namely, That of Emperours was in <note place="margin">Verſe 10.</note> being, then when <hi>John</hi> wrote this <hi>Revelation:</hi> Which kinde of Government (I mean of Emperours) being but <hi>heatheniſh</hi> at preſent, was afterward to become <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> yet ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing the ſixth head, notwithſtanding all this alteration, otherwayes the Beaſt muſt have more heads then ſeven.

               <p>But then it will be asked, when had this ſixth head the dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wound, (The ſecond thing we were to enquire concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.)</p>
               <p>But before I ſpeak directly to this query, give me leave to note theſe two things. 1. This deadly wound of the ſixth head was made by the ſword; ſo you read expreſly at the fifteenth Chapter, 14 verſe. 2. Upon this deadly wound, this ſixth head dies not, declines not, but by degrees, every ſtep of its decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, advancing the ſeventh head accordingly that was to ſucceed.</p>
               <p>This premiſed, we ſay, Then ſeems this deadly wound of the ſixth head, the head of Emperours begun to be made, when in the yeer 365 or there about. Thoſe barbarous Nations, the <hi>Almains, Quades, Gothes,</hi> with ſeverall other, broke in upon

               <p>But further in this Earthquake, <hi>The tenth part of the great Citie falls,</hi> Antichriſtianiſme in one of the ten Kingdoms falls; <note place="margin">Verſ. 13.</note> And is not this a doing?

               <p>The ſumme of all this, that I may give it you at one view, is thus much.

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:111659:50"/> end of the ſixth Trumpet, as a full ſtop and period to both of them; unleſſe we can conceive, <hi>The thouſand two hundred and threeſcore yeers of the Witneſſes Propheſie</hi> may end in one King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom after another, and the time of the ſixth Trumpet, expire in one Kingdom after another, and alſo the ſeventh Trumpet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to ſound in one Kingdom after another, which we cannot: we may not conceive the ſlaying, and riſing again of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, which are the exact periods of theſe certain, and fixed times, can be accompliſhed in one Kingdom after another neither.</p>
               <p>But enough of the former part of the objection, urging us, as too much reſtraining the killing of the Witneſſes, in regard of <hi>place,</hi> and for reſtraining it to particular <hi>perſons,</hi> which was the thing objected, I further anſwer:</p>

In ſhort, Then ſeems the Beaſt his forty two moneths to end, when the tenth part of the City falls, wherein is laid the ground-work of the ruine of all the other alſo.</p>
               <p>You have now the conceived ſlaying and riſing again of the Witneſſes which hath fallen out in our times at large repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, you have ſeen it in all the likelyhood, and advantage I could hold it forth withall: Now let every one take their liberty to ſpeak their apprehenſion in the buſineſſe; for my part, I cannot but think this ſame is like to be the <hi>ſlaying, and riſing again of the Witneſſes;</hi> only that I may not diſſemble, where I am at a ſtand, give me leave after all, to make theſe two or three queries.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When did they of the Kinreds, and people, and tongues, and nations, look upon the ſilenced Miniſters, and others of this Kingdom, who yet at the nineth verſe of this Chapter, are ſaid to look upon the dead Witneſſes?</p>
               <p n="2">2. If with the riſing of the Witneſſes, the ſecond Wo paſſes, <note place="margin">Verſ 13. 14.</note> and this ſecond Wo is the <hi>Turk,</hi> how is it we ſay the Witneſſes are riſen, and yet the <hi>Turk</hi> ſtill continuing, and like enough for ſome ſpace yet to continue?</p>
               <p n="3">3. If with the riſing of the Witneſſes the ſecond Wo paſſes, and the third Wo <hi>(viz.</hi> The ſeventh Trumpet bringing in with the beginning of it, the utter deſtruction of Antichriſt, as alſo the glorious coming and Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt) quickly follows after. Can our times be ſo neer the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of theſe, as is the end of the ſecond Wo, which is the ſixth Trumpet, to the beginning of the third Wo, which is the ſeventh Trumpet?</p>
               <p>Somewhat I could anſwer unto theſe, but not that which would <hi>quietare,</hi> (as the Schoolmen ſpeak) but theſe anſwered, I know little elſe materiall, and of weight further to be excepted.</p>
               <p>And now to draw toward a concluſion, and from all this to ſay ſomewhat to that queſtion, <hi>viz. What will become of us?</hi> which was indeed the occaſion of it all. Why if the Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:111659:51"/> be yet to be ſlain, and ſlain in this Kingdom; Then yet a little while expect and prepare for a ſuffering condition; I ſay, yet a while expect the times ſhould frown and look black up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us; yet being in no wiſe diſcouraged; for be aſſured, either this killing will never come ancer us, or if it do, being an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloody killing,</hi> we need not carry our ſelves with ſo much ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitouſneſſe in the buſineſſe. And certainly for fear of this ſame, to think to pack up, and be gone, while any work here remains, and while there is yet hope concerning us, what were it but to deſert the Cauſe, weaken the already feeble hands, and run our ſelves upon a reall danger, while we flie perhaps but from an imaginary.</p>
               <p>But if they be ſlain, and riſen again, which you have ſeen how very likely, then cheer up, ſtrengthen thoſe weak hands, certainly the bitterneſſe of death is already over, and from hence forward expect better dayes, then either our eyes, or the eyes ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <p>If this which we ſaw ere while be indeed the ſlaying and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing again of the Witneſſes, expect this ſtorm now over our heads ſhould break up ere long, and the latter part of it fall very foul on them who firſt raiſed it.</p>
               <p>Expect, That <hi>Prelacy</hi> after a while, ſhould be utterly diſſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in this Kingdom; Indeed it was ſo <hi>rooted</hi> here, that nothing leſſe then an <hi>earthquake</hi> could throw it up by the <hi>roots,</hi> and we may perhaps be ſhaken worſe yet; but by that time the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake is ended, then expect aſſuredly to be freed from <hi>root</hi> and <hi>branch</hi> alſo.</p>

            <head>Appendix.</head>
            <p>I Have already diſpatched at leaſt the ſumme of what I preached on this Subject (I mean the Propheſie of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.) In the carriage whereof, ſave only in ſome few particulars I have not much varied from the beaten tract of the lateſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and moſt received Interpreters; ſo that however in point of <hi>Computation</hi> there may be ſome difference, yet in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Interpretation,</hi> I have adventured to ſtand or fall with them. But now becauſe I would contribute all that poſſibly I could in this buſineſſe, and leave no mean unattempted for this purpoſe; I ſhould yet further crave leave to offer an other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pretation of this Propheſie, which after I entred upon this work, I have met withall, avowed alſo by ſome late Proteſtant Writers; That if ſo be any thing may be made of it, it might be here neer at hand, and thoſe who ſhould deſire to ſee as much at once, as they could in this matter, might hitherto have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, where at leaſt all the common, and likely apprehenſions in this buſineſſe are preſented.</p>
            <p>This Interpretation is not the ſame with that groſſe Popiſh, which at the beginning of this diſcourſe was there propounded: nor upon the ſame ground<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> contended for, yet withall, though not the ſame, yet neer bordering upon, and of neer affinity to it. They indeed who firſt cryed up that opinion which was formerly mentioned as the Popiſh, did it upon miſtake, the Papiſts that ſince have propagated it, did it meerly in deſign, neither whereof, this Interpretation by and by to be named, may be challenged with all.</p>
            <p>Upon miſtake I ſay, they firſt did it, for as ſome well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, <hi>Antichriſt</hi> being a <hi>Counter-Chriſt,</hi> and ſo the <hi>coming of Antichriſt,</hi> a <hi>counter Reſemblance</hi> of the <hi>coming of Chriſt,</hi> it came to paſſe there were no leſſe miſtakings in the coming of the one, then there were in the coming of the other: For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, The <hi>Jews</hi> expected <hi>Chriſt</hi> to come when he did come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:111659:52"/> and yet becauſe they fanſied him another, then indeed he was to be, and his coming to be in outward pompe, and in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſome moſt potent temporall Monarch, they knew him not when he was come. So the Chriſtians expected Antichriſt to come at that time when he came indeed, but becauſe they fanſied him to be ſome ſtrange barbarous Tyrant, that by the ſword and power of Arms ſhould not only deſtroy the Church, but conquer the world; therefore they knew him not when he was come: So that as Chriſt came to his own, and his own received him not; So Antichriſt came to thoſe that were not his own, and they eſchued him not: So that miſtakes begat the forementioned opinion concerning Antichriſt, and the ſeveralls hereupon depending.</p>
            <p>And then it became afterward propogated in deſign; I ſay, indeſign; for the Popiſh faction, to the end they might draw off the eyes of men from looking upon the <hi>Pope,</hi> as <hi>Antichriſt</hi> have bid you not to look for Antichriſt till the end of the Word, at what time <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> the <hi>two Witneſſes,</hi> as the immediate Harbingers of Chriſts ſecond coming muſt be expected alſo.</p>
            <p>But this opinion is founded upon no ſuch miſtakes, nor yet drives any ſuch deſign; grants you that Antichriſt is come, that the <hi>Pope</hi> is <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> One dividing the times of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt into three ſeverall periods. 1. The time of his riſing, and growth, mentioned at the 13. Chapter of this Propheſie and the firſt verſe. 2. The time of his declining, at the third Verſe. 3. The time of his recovering again after his deadly wound, at the 4, 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> verſes. Tells you, that in this laſt Period, this time after the deadly wound healed, there ſhall be ſome moſt cruell Savage-Monſter that ſhall then be Pope, whoſe moſt tyrannicall reign ſhall continue 42 moneths, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe time, that is, three yeers and an half underſtood in the letter, ſhall be the time of the <hi>two Witneſſes</hi> extraordinary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie alſo.</p>
            <p>But to hold you no longer from this opinion concerning the Witneſſe, Take it thus.</p>
            <p>About the time of the calling of the Jews, ſignified by the <hi>meaſuring of the Temple</hi> in the two firſt verſes of this Chapter. There are raiſed up two extraordinary Witneſſes, being two ſingle perſons, who ſhall teſtifie unto the Jews now miſled by
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:111659:52"/> the impoſtures of the falſe Prophet, then firſt brought forth are appearing in <hi>Judea,</hi> and as the Popes ſervant, and ſubſtitute, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all he poſſibly can in the behalf of him there: This their <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying in Sackcloth,</hi> laſting juſt <hi>three yeers and an half;</hi> namely all the time of the Beaſts 42 moneths, all the time of that laſt and moſt bitter perſecution, of the laſt and worſt <hi>Popiſh</hi> Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt.</p>
            <p>Theſe Witneſſes further, the better to defend themſelves and annoy and torment their enemies, as alſo undeceive the Jews miſled by the fained miracles of the <hi>falſe Prophet,</hi> ſhall indeed as once <hi>Elias by fire, deſtroy</hi> their <hi>Enemies, ſhall ſhut heaven that it rain not,</hi> and as formerly <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Aaron; turn the Waters into bloud, and ſmite the earth withall plagues as often as they will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when the three yeers and an half of their Propheſie in Sackcloth is expired, then the Beaſt, the falſe Prophet there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident <hi>ſlayes them,</hi> ſlayes them indeed; after which, their dead bodies lie juſt three dayes and an half in the ſtreet of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> which is here meant by the <hi>great City Spiritually called</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Egypt, <hi>Where alſo our Lord was crucified;</hi> where for that ſpace, the ſeverall Nations at that time there meeting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhall look upon the dead bodies of theſe two Witneſſes: During which time, the miſled inhabitants ſhall <hi>rejoyce, and make merry, and ſend preſents, becauſe now got rid of theſe two Prophets</hi> that did in their life time miſerably tormented them.</p>
            <p>But after thoſe three dayes and an half, they riſe up from the dead, after this, aſcend up to heaven in a cloud; whereupon there being a great earth-quake, the tenth part of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> falls, ſeven thouſand men ſlain, all of it to be underſtood in the letter; and all this to be done toward the end of the ſixth Trumpet.</p>
            <p>Thus you have the Interpretation: Now if any ask the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the letter is ſo exactly kept to, and this whole Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of the Witneſſes underſtood to be fulfilled in the letter; 'tis this in the generall: This part of the Propheſie, I mean all that which appertains to the Witneſſes, is not ſhewn the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet in a Viſion, but reported to him of the Angel, as an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locuter ſpeaking all this to him by word of mouth. For this is a Rule; Look what things are preſented to the ſight, by ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:111659:53"/> and images, thoſe are all to be underſtood myſtically; But the things that are repreſented to the ear, whether in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per or figurative terms, unleſſe neceſſity enforce, are to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood hiſtorically, and in the letter.</p>
            <p>This in the generall: But now further, Why [the <hi>one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand two hundred and threeſcore dayes of the Witneſſes Proph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſie in Sackeloth]</hi> are to be underſtood in the letter; Why the <hi>[great City]</hi> means <hi>[Jeruſalem]</hi> and the like: you theſe have reaſons in particular:</p>
            <p>Firſt, For the <hi>one thouſand two hundred and threeſcore dayes]</hi> to be conceived juſt <hi>three yeers and an half</hi> properly; There are theſe reaſons offered: 1. This time falls out toward the end of the ſixth Trumpet; now to conceive one thouſand two hundred and threeſcore yeers to come in toward the end of the ſixth Trumpet, how abſurd, how impoſſible. 2. This term is ſuppoſed to be the ſame with the term of that laſt, and moſt cruell perſecution, of the laſt and worſt Antichriſt, the ſame alſo with that moſt unparalell'd time of trouble menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned at the 12 <hi>Dan.</hi> 1. <hi>Such as never was ſince there was a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> which if ſo, it cannot be ſo long as that which the myſticall Interpretation contends for, but muſt be only three yeers and an half properly and in the letter ſo taken: according to which account, the two Witneſſes may well be two ſingle perſons alſo.</p>
            <p>The reaſon why the <hi>turning waters into blood,</hi> and <hi>ſmiting the earth with all plagues</hi> be to be underſtood in the letter alſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that in the generall before mentioned, is becauſe ſome ſuch thing as this, is expected to be done about the time of the Converſion of the Jews; ſo you finde, <hi>Mich.</hi> 7. 15, 16. <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the day<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And then the reaſon, why theſe <hi>two Witneſſes,</hi> who alſo are called <hi>two Prophets,</hi> together with the <hi>falſe Prophet,</hi> have all of them reference to the <hi>Jews,</hi> being all of them to reſide there, is this, becauſe whereſoever you finde mention of Prophets, whether true, or falſe, there is ſtill a reference had unto the Jews, to whom only it was peculiar, and their great privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, to be furniſhed with the Miniſtery of extraordinary Prophets.</p>
            <pb n="95" facs="tcp:111659:53"/>
            <p>And then laſtly the reaſons, why <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is here to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by <hi>the great City,</hi> and not <hi>Rom</hi> (as is commonly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; are firſt, becauſe theſe two are expreſly diſtinguiſhed at the 16 Chapter of this Propheſie, and 18, 19, verſes, where you finde the great City, that is, <hi>Jeruſalem, is divided into three parts,</hi> and <hi>great Babylon,</hi> that is, <hi>Rome</hi> comes into remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, being there mentioned as two dinſtinct places. Beſides, <hi>Rome</hi> is no where in Scripture called <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> but <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is: <hi>Sodom</hi> 'tis called, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 1. 10. and <hi>Egypt</hi> it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 23. 18, 19: And further, <hi>Rome</hi> was not the place where our Lord was crucified, but <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and therefore when 'tis here ſaid, <hi>[The Witneſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And now you have together with the Interpretation, the reaſons (a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
